Do we have the ball?
    (yes) Position good enough to score?
        (yes) Shoot
        (no) Move to better position
    (no) Does the opponent have the ball?
        (yes) Is the opponent closer to our goal than us?
            (yes) Move at maximum speed to our goal
            (no) Mirror movement of opponent and reduce distance
        (no) Move towards predicted location of ball

Penalty defense
    Draw a line following orientation of other robot and a line parallel to the
    goal - move to intersection of these two lines.
    Execute random short movements left/right of this position.

Determine if robot should shoot
    score = [0..1] = weighted sum of:
        distance to goal
        magnitude of angle between robot and goal posts
        opponent is in way
    add a bit of non determinism to be harder to predict:
        if score > uniform(0, 1): shoot
