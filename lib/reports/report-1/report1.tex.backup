\section{Overview}
My position in the team was `Software Lead' which meant that in addition to actual development work, I was also in charge of the assignment and overseeing of development tasks. My main contributions were in Vision, Strategy and Control subsystems, but I also worked at some point or another on all of the other components. Thus, at any point, I knew how all the subsytems worked and how they interacted which allowed me to act as liaison between the different subteams as well.
